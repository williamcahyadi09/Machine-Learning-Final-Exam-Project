# Machine-Learning-Final-Exam-Project
This is my project for my Machine Learning Final Exam.

I am asked to predict prices and review scores rating using different kinds of methods such as Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine, K-nearest neighbor, Decision tree. Not only that, but I was also asked to implement clustering using Gaussian Mixture Model and K-means clustering to see the distribution of my features.

Additionally, I also implemented Feature engineering,Undersampling, oversampling, and feature selection in this project.
